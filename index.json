[{"body":"Based on your preferred installation method, follow one of the following two sections to install Regolith:\nOption 1: Ubuntu Installer  Download an ISO image  (both the Ubuntu LTS 18.04 and most recent 19.10 bases are available) and then use an OS installation tool such as USB Creator to write the downloaded file into a USB device. Here are Ubuntu guides for performing this action in Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. Reboot the computer and select the USB flash drive to boot from. Install or run the live environment by providing information when prompted during the setup process. See this tutorial to learn more about the installation process. When prompted, reboot the computer and login to your new Regolith environment!  Option 2: PPA  See below about PPA sources, and add your chosen PPA to your system:   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release  Install the Regolith desktop package:   $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop  Reboot the computer, and when logging in select the \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; session in the gear menu (⚙️):  Reinstallation In the case that the Regolith desktop environment becomes corrupted or otherwise unbootable, follow these steps to reset it. No user files will be removed as part of this process:\n Login to the stock Ubuntu session. If this session is not available, install it with sudo apt install ubuntu-session. After installing this, you will have the option to select the Ubuntu session type in the login screen. Uninstall Regolith from within the Ubuntu session:  $ sudo apt remove regolith-* $ sudo apt autoremove Verify that no regolith packages are still installed with apt list --installed | grep -i regolith. The command should not return any packages. If it does, manually uninstall them with sudo apt remove \u0026lt;package\u0026gt;. Reinstall Regolith:  $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop Reboot the computer, and when logging in select the \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; session in the gear menu.  Uninstallation of regolith-desktop Simply follow these steps to remove Regolith from your system:\n Log out of the Regolith session and into the default Ubuntu session. Open a terminal and run:  $ sudo apt remove regolith-desktop regolith-st \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt autoremove Now remove the PPA:  $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release To restore your GNOME settings, run:  $ source ~/.regolith-gnome-backup You can safely delete the file ~/.config/regolith.  PPA Sources There are 4 sources for Regolith packages for release 1.3. The release PPA is recommended for most users, but another may be better for you based on your needs.

For example, another look sporting the Solarized color palette and a different GTK theme and icon set is called regolith-look-solarized-dark.\nFinding Looks All look packages using this naming scheme can be found via the following command:\n$ apt list | grep regolith-look Installing a Look Looks can be installed via the apt tool or with any tool that can install Debian packages on the system, such as synaptic. For example, this command will install the Ubuntu look:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-look-ubuntu If you pay attention to the output of apt you may notice that in addition to installing the look, fonts-font-awesome will also be installed. As a feature, looks are able to depend on any resources or artifacts they require as packages. This ensures that once a look is installed, the user does not need to care about what other things that look make require to function properly. It's taken care of by the package manager.\nSwitching to a Look Once a look has been installed, a utility command called regolith-look can be used to enable it. To enable the ubuntu look installed in the previous step, try the following:\n$ regolith-look set ubuntu $ regolith-look refresh The command will mention that it created a file in your user directory. This file is an Xresource file, and it's stored in a specific path such that i3-gnome-flashback will look for it upon session start. Let's have a look at the file:\n$ cat ~/.Xresources-regolith #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root\u0026#34; In essence, our Xresource file is simply pointing to another Xresource file. Lets look there:\n$ cat /etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root ! -- Styles - Colors #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/color\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Fonts #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/typeface\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Theme #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/theme\u0026#34; ! -- Applications ! These files map values defined above into specific app settings. #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/st-term\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3xrocks\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/rofi\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/gnome\u0026#34; Here we can see that there are separate Xresource files that define color, typeface and theme (icon, GTK), and these are loaded and then applied to the UI components integrated by Regolith: st (terminal), i3-wm, i3xrocks, rofi, and GNOME.\nRefreshing a Look There may be times that the UI of the system and the Regolith look get out of sync. For example, if a program sets the wallpaper or icon theme externally, this will not be reflected in the Xresource settings. Regolith will only update itself upon login if it detects of Xresource changes have been made. If you wish to force Regolith to reload the UI based on the Xresource settings, run:\n$ regolith-look refresh Learning More To dig deeper, read about Styles in the following page and have a look at the regolith-styles README.\n","excerpt":"Looks provided by Regolith have the package prefix regolith-look-. For example, another look …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/customize/look/","title":"Look"},{"body":"Regolith is a collection of open source components that together form a desktop environment. Almost all of the UI components that are used to build Regolith are independent open source projects that have simply been configured for a specific workflow and visual aesthetic. Most computer desktop environments are optimized for ease-of-use and familiarity with commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple's OS X. In contrast, Regolith provides a way of interacting with a computer that is optimized for user productivity.\nThe Keyboard, the Mouse, and the Monitor Regolith places emphasis on the keyboard input device over the mouse, in relation to most other desktop environments. This is for one reason: productivity. But this benefit comes with a one-time cost: learning the keybindings. In exchange for this up-front cost, the user is subsequently able to perform general computer actions faster and with less foreground thought. Additionally, by pushing more of the computer actions into the user's memory, more of the computer's visual interface can be devoted to the user's applications. Put another way, the Regolith interface devotes more bandwidth to the user's application and less to the general management of the computer. And because ultimately the productive output of the user is a result of interaction with applications, the general productivity of the user is enhanced. This is a subjective benefit, and may be more or less important to the user.\nTiling Windows Perhaps the most user-impacting component in Regolith is the window manager, an open source project called i3-gaps (which is a customization of i3-wm). This program organizes windows into tiles. By default, i3-gaps strives to fill the entire screen with tiles. If only one program is presenting a window, then that window occupies the entire screen. For two windows, both get an equal portion of the screen, and so on. By using keybindings, the user can tell i3-gaps to resize, move, and otherwise organize windows in other ways. A key advantage to this approach is that the user is freed from micro managing window layouts (at the cost of having to learn the keybindings).\nLaunching Applications It is common for desktop environments to display application launchers throughout the user interface, in the form of icons and text. Folders, docks, and context menus are used to present a form of menu to the user. Despite them appearing visually different, they are have one function: to launch an application. As with keybindings, in Regolith this user interface of launching apps is refined and minimized. Desktop icons, panels, and docks are not used. Rather, the user invokes the application launcher which presents a menu of applications sorted by frequency of usage. The user may begin typing the name or function of the application they intend to load and the list is filtered accordingly. In addition, frequently used applications such as terminal and browser have specific keybindings. With this UI treatment, there is no fixed overhead on the display for the presentation of application launchers. This provides the user benefit of more screen space devoted to the user's applications.\nSystem Management Modern computers are complex machines with many observable attributes. For the day-to-day operation however, most of these can be ignored. Each user has a specific subset of system state they care about, and so there is no one perfect configuration for every user. By default Regolith provides on-screen state information on the bar for the user's workspaces, keybindings help, network and CPU utilization, notifications, and the system time. More or less items can be configured by the user as needed.\nIn addition to the transient system information provided on the bar, the system configuration can be changed by the user via the Settings application. This configuration system is part of GNOME, and provides a rich set of UI pages to configure WiFi networks, Bluetooth devices, displays, and other devices.\nWhere should I go next?

Keybindings Dialog  To allow for a more consistent look and collapsible content for various monitor dimensions, a custom shortcut dialog was developed called Remontoire.   Pluggable Compositors  The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none.   i3-snapshot  In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room...). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session.   New Rofi theme  Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting.   New notification UI based on Rofication  The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click.   Floating Control Panel  The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.   Clickable Bar Status Actions  For convienence, the default blocks on the bar will launch configuration apps for the associated block. For example, the battery block will launch the power settings control panel, and the notification block will launch the notification viewer.   Discrete and packagable Looks  The underlying style framework used by Regolith has been revamped to allow for \"looks\": colors, themes, typeface, and other thematic state. Looks can be switched with a single command.   New bar status components  Network, keybindings, notifications, focused window, and other blocklets have been improved and added.   Build System  Build scripts were added and improved to allow for the generation of Regolith packages in an automated fashion, making it easier for others to roll their own.   Website  An entirely new website is launching with R1.3, to integrate more content and make it faster for users to find information.    Fixes  i3-gaps-wm: Fix for workspace label bug on startup. Revamping some keybindings based on user feedback. i3xrocks: numerous tweaks and fixes for status indicators. regolith-gnome-flashback: numerous fixes and policy enhancements to session management.  ISO Generation The following commands were applied to the Regolith Install ISO in the Cubic tool:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository universe \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release $ sudo apt remove aisleriot branding-ubuntu cheese* gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku gnome-mines gnome-todo* gnome-video-* libchees* libgnome-games* libreoffice* remmina* rhythmbox* shotwell* thunderbird* totem* ure ubuntu-session ubuntu-web-launchers $ apt install regolith-desktop regolith-gdm3-theme $ sudo apt autoremove $ cp /usr/share/backgrounds/lucas-bellator-C0OD8OM-oM0-unsplash.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png The purpose of removing several packages such as games and libreoffice was to reduce the ISO size.

While it's possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files. As such Regolith, upon login, will look for user-staged version of configuration files and load those instead of the defaults if they exist. This is recommended over editing the files in /etc/regolith directly as it gives the user more control over their configuration. This page describes how to create these files.\nDepending on what you wish to change, you may need your own copy if the i3 config file, Xresources, or both. If you're looking to change the way Regolith looks, Xresources may be all you need. If you want to update or add keybindings or swap out components, you'll most likely need to stage the i3 config file.\ni3 Config  Copy the default Regolith i3 config file into your home directory:  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith/i3 $ cp /etc/regolith/i3/config ~/.config/regolith/i3/config Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/i3.  Verify the Change  Verify by running i3 --moreversion and noting the config file that is printed as a result. It should be the copy you just created. If not, be sure the path is correct. It must exactly be ~/.config/regolith/i3/config for Regolith to load it.  Regolith Styles  Copy the root Regolith Xresource file into your home directory:  $ cp /etc/regolith/styles/root ~/.Xresources-regolith Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/styles.  Note that this root file is simply a reference to other styles that are broken down by the thing they are designed to style. For example, if you wish to customize the look of i3, you will need to also copy /etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm into your user directory and then update the reference to the new file in your ~/.Xresources-regolith.\n","excerpt":"Regolith uses a number of files in /etc/regolith to determine the behavior and look of various …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/howto/stage-configs/","title":"Stage config files"},{"body":"As mentioned in the Getting Started section, super space causes i3 to execute Rofi to present a list of apps. Once launched, the application selected will open a window on the currently active workspace. If other windows are already present on this workspace, they will be resized to allow the new window to also be placed without overlapping or otherwise obstructing the existing windows.\nWindow Layout super backspace can be used to toggle between horizontal and vertical layout modes, which will apply to the next launched application. In this way, windows in a workspace can divide the screen into portions relative to the desired importance of the user.\nIn addition to toggling layout orientation, existing windows can be moved relative to their neighbors with super shift ↑ ↓ ← → (arrow keys) or VIM-style arrow keys k j h l. Or, super tab and super shift tab can be used to move back and forth between active workspaces.\nWindows can also be directly moved to other workspaces. The bar will indicate all active workspaces as well as the currently focused workspace. super shift [0-9] will cause the currently focused window to be moved to the workspace number selected.\nUsers can navigate to windows via super [0-9] but can also directly navigate to a specific window with super ctrl space.\nQuit an Application. Unfortunately in Linux there is no convention that all applications follow for how to quit. In traditional desktop environments, users often rely on the close box of the window or a global menu system. Because Regolith has a reduced UI, depending on the application these common mouse-driven ways of exiting apps may not be available. Depending on the app, one of the following keybindings may cause it to exit:\n ctrl w ctrl W ctrl q ctrl Q ctrl d alt F4  If none of these commands work, it may be that the application has crashed and is not responding to requests from the window manager. In this case you can kill the focused application with super shift q\n","excerpt":"As mentioned in the Getting Started section, super space causes i3 to execute Rofi to present a list …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/interface/apps/","title":"Working with Applications"},{"body":"While we'll cover everything in greater detail in other areas of the documentation, this page covers the very basic users need to know in order to use Regolith.\nThe Super Key Most keybindings you'll be using with Regolith start with the super key. This key typically says \u0026ldquo;WIN\u0026rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command ⌘ key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super maps to in your configuration if you choose to.\nLaunch an Application After logging in, you'll be at a blank screen with the bar at the bottom and some keyboard shortcuts on the right. To launch an application, press super space and a menu will be presented with all of the applications installed on the system. If you begin typing the name of the application you wish to launch, the list will filter down to only matching names. You can also scroll through the list with the arrow keys.\nTerminal The terminal is a special application that has it's own keybinding, super enter.\nBrowser The preferred browser is also special, and can be launched with super shift enter.\nQuit an Application. super shift q will send the kill signal to the focused application. Additionally, depending on the app, one of the following keybindings may cause it to exit:\n ctrl w ctrl W ctrl q ctrl Q ctrl d alt F4  Switching Workspaces A primary way of managing how applications occupy the screen is by the usage of workspaces. A workspace is in essence a group of zero or more applications that all present windows on the same physical display. Users can switch workspaces to \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; more space for applications to occupy. Windows can be moved across workspaces. Workspaces can be tied to physical display or be moved to other displays as needed. To switch workspaces, hold down the super key and press one of the number keys. This will navigate to that workspace. If any windows exist in a given workspace, it will show in the bar as being active. Thus, by referring to the bar the user can known of which workspaces active applications live.\nFurther Reading More keybindings are listed in Remontoire, the shortcut application. This app is loaded automatically on the first session, but not on successive logins. The window can be toggled at any time by clicking the circled i icon in the bar, or pressing super shift ?.\n","excerpt":"While we'll cover everything in greater detail in other areas of the documentation, this page covers …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/getting-started/basics/","title":"Basics"},{"body":"Depending on your preference (or keyboard), you may prefer a key other than Super to be used as the primary i3 keybinding.

There are two primary ways of installing Regolith; via an Ubuntu-based installer and via a Personal Package Archive (PPA). Either of these methods will result in essentially the same user experience, although installing via the Ubuntu installer will result in a package selection that is different from installing vanilla Ubuntu. However by adding and removing specific packages a vanilla Ubuntu system can be configured.\nPrerequisites Ubuntu Installer  A modern computer that can boot from a USB flash drive. Free space on a local drive. The installer will allow for managing existing partitions or installing on an empty volume. An internet connection to install updates during and after installation. A monitor with at least VGA (1024 x 768) resolution. Regolith is optimized for FHD (1920 x 1080) screens. An empty USB flash drive with at least 4 Gb of storage space.

An internet connection to install updates during and after installation.  Deciding on Installation Method If you already have an Ubuntu system of a supported version, than adding Regolith via PPA is the faster and less disruptive method. The Ubuntu installer method is better for starting from scratch, installing into a virtual machine, or just ensuring that any existing software is not conflicting with Regolith.

Xresources employes the C preprocessor to allow for complex behaviors such as including more files, defining constants, and conditional expressions. In Regolith, only two preprocessor directives are used: include and define. include statements are used to reference other files. Collections of files called looks were covered in the previous section of this guide. define statements are a little more involved.\nDefines To maximize the re-use of theme information in Regolith, Xresources are divided into two categories of files: definition files and application files. The definition files make heavy use of the define directive. They essentially bind an abstract key, such as \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;terminal font\u0026rdquo; to a literal value, such as #0000FF or Source Code Pro Medium. In making changes to files, it's expected that these defines will change. The user may wish to specify a different icon set, or typeface, and would do so by modifying or creating a new definition file. Once this file is created, it needs to be referenced by a top-level Xresource file in ~/Xresource-regolith.\nApplication Xresource files As mentioned previously, in /etc/regolith/styles lives a number of Xresources, including those for specific applications such as st or i3-wm. Opening these files will show a mapping of the abstract keys provided by the defines files to application specific keys. In this way, the general description of the look can be mapped to any UI component or application that can read from Xresources.\nLoading Order The i3-gnome-flashback session init script will check for an Xresources file in the following order:\n ~/.Xresources-regolith /etc/regolith/styles/root  In addition to a Regolith Xresources file, ~/.Xresources will also be loaded if it exists upon session start.\nReloading Xresources The xrdb command can be used to refresh Xresource values after they have changed. For example, to reload the user Xresource file run:\n$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources-regolith Verification You can test that a change has been made to your Xresources file by querying it from the command line. If a change was made to key foo.bar then the following command will return it's current value, or empty if unset:\n$ xrescat foo.bar empty ","excerpt":"As stated in the repo readme, Regolith styles are a convention by which a set of files which define …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/customize/styles/","title":"Styles"},{"body":"Regolith Linux is continually being updated with bug fixes and feature enhancements.

Many desktop environments integrate a compositor directly into the window manager, making it difficult to switch out or disable. In Regolith, the compositor is defined as a pluggable \u0026ldquo;extension point\u0026rdquo; in the packaging system. This means that compositors can be switched out simply by installing the packages that contain them. The underlying packaging system will ensure there are no conflicts and that all the dependencies of a given compositor are also installed.\nFinding Available Compositors The following command will list all compositors configured to work with Regolith:\napt list | grep regolith-compositor- At least the following three compositors should be available:\n   Package Name Backend Description     regolith-compositor-compton-glx Compton The default compositor for Regolith.

If you'd like to test fixes that haven't made it to the stable PPA yet or would just like to always be using the latest updates, the following steps describe how the unstable PPA is added:\nFrom your existing Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic), 19.04 (Disco), or 19.10 (Eoan) system, perform the following installation steps:\n First we need to remove the regolith-stable PPA. Open a terminal, and enter: sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:kgilmer/regolith-stable Now enter the following to add regolith-unstable: sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:regolith-linux/unstable After the sync completes, enter: sudo apt install regolith-desktop The following command will need to be ran sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt full-upgrade Some packages will be upgraded. When this completes, reboot.  Reverting to regolith-stable Simply follow the steps #1 and #2 in reverse. Keep in mind that the package manager will not downgrade your packages, so if you want to just use what's in regolith-stable, you may need to uninstall Regolith and reinstall it.

A key difference between Regolith and other environments described as minimal is the integration of the GNOME settings backend. This provides a well-tested, consistent, and friendly way of configuring your environment and computer. To load the settings app, launch \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; from Rofi or press super c.\nSettings is a special app in Regolith in that it is launched in floating mode. This is because typically when loading settings a user is looking to make a specific change and then exit back to their work. Once loaded use the tab sections on the left of the window to select which item you wish to configure.\ni3-wm The i3 window manager is not part of GNOME and so it's configuration is not viewable or changable from the GNOME control center. Rather, the user must edit the config file and reload i3 to make changes. In Regolith, the i3 config file is at /etc/regolith/i3/config and users can supply their own copy that will override this default if placed at ~/.config/regolith/i3/config.\nMany things about Regolith can be configured in the i3 config file. It is best to read the i3 user guide to understand what and how to modify this file.\ni3bar The i3bar configuration is defined in the i3 config file listed directly above, but the i3bar has it's own configuration for status items. To change which information is displayed in the bar, the default file is /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/config and can be overridden by the user by specifying a new path in the i3 config file, as described above.\nMost status elements in the bar are configured to launch an app upon click that is associated with the data presented by the element. For example the date/time element will launch the time settings panel in gnome-control-panel. These scripts live in /usr/share/i3xrocks and can be configured as needed.\nLook The look of Regolith is configured via Xresources, that live in /etc/regolith/styles/. This topic is covered in detail in the Customize section of the documentation.\nSession When Regolith is initially loaded, a script is run that configures the system and launches i3-wm. While it is not recommended to modify this script, it can provide details about how Regolith is structured and what policy it implements when loading configuration. This file is readable at /usr/bin/i3-gnome-flashback.

However efforts have been made to create as much consistency as possible by utilizing a simple session-wide key-value configuration facility known as Xresources. Interface preferences such as colors and typeface are defined in Xresource files and then read by components such as st-term and i3-wm. For the most part, Xresources can be used for higher level changes. Lower level changes, for example swap out i3bar for polybar, or drun for Rofi, require more fundamental changes.\nIn addition to the content in this section, refer to the tutorials for step-by-step examples of how to customize Regolith.\n Look The highest level change in the way Regolith looks is called a \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo;. This ties together color, typeface, GTK theme and icons into a packagable unit known as a look. A few looks ship in the Regolith PPA, the default for R1.3 being called Cahuella.\nStyles Regolith looks are a collection of style definitions that are bundled together as a cohesive whole. But, what if you want to mix and match from different looks or make small tweaks to an existing look? Well, the Xresource files that define the looks can be modified directly. For example, to continue to use the Cahuella look but change the default font from Source Code Pro to, say Ubuntu Mono, one would just need to modify the typeface Xresource file to specify the new font (assuming it's already installed on the system).\nCompositors A compositor is a desktop component that provides visual effects to windows. While not necessary for a desktop to function, they provide some hints to the user regarding the focused application, transitions, and other effects. The performance and behavior of compositors can vary depending on graphics hardware and driver configurations. Due to this, special attention was made such that they can be easily swapped based on the users needs.\nComponents A deeper level of customization is to change which components are loaded and used. This is an advanced topic and requires both some courage to deal with the unexpected as well as general technical knowledge and some patience.\nPackages Regolith is ultimately a set of Debian packages that exist as collections of files on the user's computer. Packages can be created and hosted by anyone willing and able to create a launchpad account and some skills with packaging.
